2. Right-click on the domain name, select **New** > **Organizational Unit**.

## Creating User Groups Within the OUs
1. Within each OU, create user groups as required. For example, in the Engineering OU, you might create a group called `EngineeringGroup`, while in the IT OU, you could create `ITManagement`, etc.
